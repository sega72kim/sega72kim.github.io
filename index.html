      <h4 class="citata">A LITTLE HISTORY</h4>
        <p class="name">According o Moore's Law, the number of transistors placed on an
          integrated circuit doubles every 24 months, while the performance
          of modern processors doubles every 18 months. The viability of this
          law is direct evidence of the incessantly rapid development of the IT
          industry in the modern world. Just like any rapidly developing
          industry, the IT sector has a certain impact on the environment every
          day, both positively and negatively</p>

  <div class="container34">
    <div class="centered-stripe2"></div>
    <div class="text-left">
<div class="headache">1. Development of Environmentally Friendly
  Technologies</div>
  <div class="headache2">We can note the rapid development of
    environmentally friendly technologies, replacing past technologies affecting air pollution and
    other environmental factors. The most obvious examples are electric vehicles; these cars
    significantly reduce emissions of pollutants and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, thus
    significantly helping to preserve the environment. Without the development of the IT
    industry, the emergence of electric cars would have been practically impossible due to the
    absence of smart algorithms and programs for their operation.</div>

    <div class="space"></div>
    <div class="space"></div>
        <div class="headache">3. Remote work and reduced commuting
          </div>
          <div class="headache2">The third significant
            advantage of IT industry development is the ability for many employees to work remotely.
            Remote work significantly reduces commuting; working from home reduces the need for
            constant trips to work, thereby reducing emissions of pollutants and traffic congestion.
            Remote work also saves energy consumed by giant offices and reduces the consumption of
            paper resources.</div>

      <div class="headache">2. Enhanced Process Efficiency</div>
      <div class="headache2">The advancement of information technology has led to a significant enhancement in the efficiency of processes across various spheres of our lives. Automation, digitization, and the use of smart algorithms have optimized workflows, improved service quality, and increased productivity. One of the key advantages of such development is the ability to more efficiently utilize resources while preserving the environment.

      <div class="space"></div>
      <div class="space"></div>
<div class="headache">2. Component production</div>
  <div class="headache2">The second no less significant
    problem is the production of components. The manufacture of computers, smartphones, and
    other devices requires resource extraction, which can lead to ecosystem destruction, soil
    degradation, and the release of toxic substances. The production of many electronic devices requires rare materials such as lithium for batteries or rare earth metals for electronics. Their extraction and processing are often associated with environmental issues, including soil and water pollution.</div>

      <div class="space"></div>
      <div class="headache">1. Energy consumption of server centers</div>
        <div class="headache2">The first major problem that we must note is the high energy consumption of server centers.
Large server centers consume an enormous amount of energy to maintain operation, leading
to the emission of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. Most modern technological innovations require powerful servers and data centers that consume enormous amounts of energy. The cooling processes of these centers also require additional resources. This leads to high energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases, negatively affecting the climate.</div>

<div class="headache">3. Increasing amount of electronic waste</div>
        <div class="headache2">The final drawback of IT industry
          development is the increasing amount of electronic waste. The rapid cycle of updating and
          replacing electronics leads to an increase in electronic waste, which often is not properly
          disposed of, creating environmental problems. In addition the rapid advancement of technology leads to the emergence of obsolete equipment. Waste from computers, mobile devices, and other electronic gadgets becomes a significant issue. Not all of 
          these devices are properly recycled, which can result in the release of toxic substances into the environment. Components such as lead and cadmium can negatively impact water and soil resources.</div>

  <h4 class="citata24">Solutions for problems</h4>
  <div class="solut">
  <div class="headache">1. Improvement of modern technologies</div>
    <div class="headache2">Strengthening and implementing modern technologies play a pivotal role in addressing environmental issues. The effective utilization of IT innovations, 
      energy-efficient technologies, smart cities, and digital educational resources reduces the adverse impact on the environment. Promoting energy efficiency, fostering sustainable production methods, 
      and utilizing digital platforms for environmental education are crucial. 
      These advancements in technology not only reduce the negative impact on the environment but also contribute to creating a more sustainable and healthier future for all.</div>

      <div class="space"></div>
      <div class="headache">2. Environmentally friendly materials</div>
    <div class="headache2">The development of eco-friendly materials for the IT industry will address environmental issues significantly.
       Utilizing materials based on biodegradable components or renewable resources reduces the adverse impact on the environment. 
       These materials possess low toxicity levels and can be disposed of without significant harm to ecosystems.
        Eco-friendly materials also contribute to waste reduction, enhance production sustainability,
       thereby diminishing the environmental footprint of the IT sector and preserving nature for future generations.</div>

       <img src="image11.jpg" alt="Image 5" class="priroda">
       <div class="space"></div>
       <div class="headache">3. Encourage IT companies</div>
    <div class="headache2">Involving IT companies in addressing environmental issues is beneficial for ecology for several reasons. 
      Firstly, the IT industry has the capability to develop innovative technologies for monitoring and managing the environment, 
      effectively tracking and reducing adverse impacts on ecosystems. Secondly, many IT companies strive for energy efficiency in
       their data centers and infrastructure, reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Thirdly, the IT industry supports 
       the development of innovative eco-friendly solutions, including the use of biodegradable materials and waste management technologies. 
      All these aspects enhance companies' sustainability towards environmental challenges and contribute to preserving nature.</div>
